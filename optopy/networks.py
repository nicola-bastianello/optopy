#%% NETWORK CLASSES

class Network():
    """
    Representation of an undirected network.
    
    The class implements an undirected network defined from the adjacency
    matrix. The class provides methods for different communication protocols,
    such as node-to-node and broadcast.
    
    Transmissions are implemented via the `buffer` attribute of the network:
    the sender stores the packet to be transmitted in the `buffer` dictionary,
    specifying the recipient, which can then access the packet.
    
    By convention, the nodes in the network are indexed from :math:`0` to
    :math:`N-1`, where :math:`N` is the total number of nodes.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    adj_mat : ndarray
        The adjacency matrix of the network.
    N : ndarray
        The number of nodes in the network.
    weights : ndarray
        The consensus weight matrix, if not specified in the constructor
        this is the Metropolis-Hastings weight matrix.
    neighbors : list
        A list whose :math:`i`-th element is a list of node :math:`i`'s
        neighors.
    degrees : list
        The number of neighbors of each node.
    buffer : dict
        The dictionary used for node-to-node transmissions.
