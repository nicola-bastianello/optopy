At present, **optopy** is a clone of [**tvopt**](https://github.com/nicola-bastianello/tvopt), but in the future it will include more functionalities, with the goal of delivering a module suited to the benchmarking of both *static* and *dynamic* optimization algorithms.

**tvopt** is a prototyping and benchmarking Python framework for time-varying (or online) optimization. The framework is modular,
and provides different tools for modeling dynamic optimization problems and to solve them with a wide range of well known
algorithms.

The documentation is available [here](https://optopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
 

## Installation
**optopy** works on Python 3.7 and depends on: numpy, scipy.

### pip installation
```
pip install optopy
```
